Here are some projects that I (Jerome Pullen Jr.) have completed using Python:

<b>Connect 4 Game with Artificial Intelligence</b>:

Uses pygame to create a Connect 4 game and nympy/math/random to create an AI using the Minimax Algorithm to play against:

<b>Auto Mouse Move and Click</b>:

Uses pyautogui to automate moving and clicking of the mouse for certain (X,Y) coordinates:

<b>Find Mouse Position</b>:

Uses pyautogui to find the current (X,Y) coordinates of the mouse position (works as a companion "auto_mouse_move_and_click.py"):
